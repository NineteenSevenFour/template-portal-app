# **NX micro-frontend setup guide**

This guide will provides step by step to build a web micro-frontend application structured with NX workspace. There are two different templates. One for application and one for library. Your project will most likely be splitted into multiple workspaces that are managed by different team building up their own micro-frontend applications and libraries to interface with the host.

## **Create workspace**

We will use the `create-nx-workspace` package to generate the workspace. Refers to the [NX website](https://nx.dev/nx/create-nx-workspace) for additional information.

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace MyApp --name MyApp --style scss --preset apps --nxCloud false --skipGit true --ci github
```

> TIP: Run the command without arguments to have the interactive mode on.

> TIP: Using something like `@MyOrgMyApp` as first parameter will create a nested folder structure, but the application name wil be MyApp.

## **Create Host/Remote application**

To create the `host` application and optional libraries specific to the application, We will use the `@nrwl/angular` nx plugin generator.

First, install the NX angular generator plugin.

```bash
npm install @nrwl/angular@13 -D
```

### **Host application**
Once the angular plugin is installed, we can generate the host application for our portal.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:host host --style=scss --prefix=portal-host --strict --dynamic --backendProject=http://localhost:9999/api --port 8100
```

> INFO: `--dynamic` allows for runtime micro-frontend rather than static.

> TIP: Add `--dry-run` to validate the options will generate whatÂ´d you expect.

### **Remote application**
Alternatively, we can generate a workspace for a remote application instead of a Host. You can even have both Host and Remote within the same workspace.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:host host --style=scss --prefix=portal-host --strict --dynamic --backendProject=http://localhost:9999/api --port 8100
```

> TIP: run `nx g rm Myapp` to remove the application or library.

### **Create first library**

Architecturing a micro-frontend is no more different than any other application. As such, we can create libraries that will be componsed of services, model, api (interfaces) and even components.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:lib MyLib --prefix=portal-mylib --importPath=@portal/mylib --buildable --strict
```

## **Create first service**

To add a service within the newly created `MyLib` library. run the following commmand.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:service MyService --project=portal-mylib
```

## **Create first component**

To add a componet within the newly created `MyLib` library. run the following commmand.

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:component MyComponent --project=portal-mylib
```
